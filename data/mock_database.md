# Aura Clinical Knowledge Base

## Condition: Hypothyroidism
**Epidemiological Risk:** High/Common
**Core Presentation:** Fatigue, unexplained weight gain, sluggishness, depressed mood.
**Differentiating Symptoms:** Cold intolerance, severe constipation, dry skin, hair loss.
**Clinical Gap Strategy (Rule-Out):** If core presentation matches but differentiating symptoms are unknown, the physician MUST ask about temperature sensitivity or skin changes.

## Condition: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
**Epidemiological Risk:** High/Common
**Core Presentation:** Depressed mood, fatigue, loss of interest, sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia).
**Differentiating Symptoms:** Feelings of worthlessness, suicidal ideation, lack of physiological triggers (e.g., normal thyroid function).
**Clinical Gap Strategy (Rule-Out):** If fatigue and mood changes are present, the physician MUST rule out physiological causes (like thyroid dysfunction) before confirming MDD.

## Condition: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
**Epidemiological Risk:** Medium/Common (highly correlated with recent weight gain)
**Core Presentation:** Severe daytime exhaustion, unrefreshing sleep, recent weight gain.
**Differentiating Symptoms:** Loud snoring, witnessed breathing pauses during sleep, morning headaches.
**Clinical Gap Strategy (Rule-Out):** If patient reports exhaustion and weight gain, the physician MUST ask if a partner has noticed snoring or gasping during sleep.

## Condition: Iron Deficiency Anemia
**Epidemiological Risk:** High/Common (especially in women of childbearing age)
**Core Presentation:** Fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness.
**Differentiating Symptoms:** Pale skin, cold hands/feet, brittle nails, unusual cravings (pica).
**Clinical Gap Strategy (Rule-Out):** If fatigue and weakness are present, the physician MUST ask about dietary iron intake or history of heavy menstrual cycles.

## Condition: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/ME)
**Epidemiological Risk:** Low/Medium
**Core Presentation:** Extreme exhaustion, sleep problems, cognitive issues ("brain fog").
**Differentiating Symptoms:** Post-exertional malaise (PEM), symptoms lasting >6 months, symptoms not improved by rest.
**Clinical Gap Strategy (Rule-Out):** If fatigue persists after rest and other metabolic/hormonal causes are ruled out, the physician MUST ask if symptoms worsen significantly after minor physical or mental exertion.

## Condition: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
**Epidemiological Risk:** High/Common
**Core Presentation:** Fatigue, sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep), irritability, muscle tension.
**Differentiating Symptoms:** Excessive, uncontrollable worry about various topics, feeling "keyed up" or on edge.
**Clinical Gap Strategy (Rule-Out):** If sleep and fatigue are primary complaints but mood is characterized by worry rather than sadness, the physician MUST screen for GAD-7 symptoms.

## Condition: Vitamin D Deficiency
**Epidemiological Risk:** High/Common (highly seasonal/geographical)
**Core Presentation:** Fatigue, bone pain, muscle weakness, mood changes.
**Differentiating Symptoms:** Frequent infections, hair loss, vague musculoskeletal "aching."
**Clinical Gap Strategy (Rule-Out):** If fatigue is accompanied by non-specific body aches, the physician MUST ask about sun exposure, diet, and history of bone fractures.

## Condition: Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
**Epidemiological Risk:** High/Common
**Core Presentation:** Fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores.
**Differentiating Symptoms:** Increased thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), unexplained weight loss despite increased appetite.
**Clinical Gap Strategy (Rule-Out):** If fatigue is present alongside weight fluctuations, the physician MUST ask about urinary frequency or excessive thirst to differentiate from metabolic or thyroid issues.
